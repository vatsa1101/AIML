The given question has data about the amount of rainfall in a city and in which region the city lies in. In the above code, first all the names of cities and regions were stored which were mentioned in the problem statement and then the facts are stored.I used prolog language in the above code as it helps to solve logic based questions easily by setting facts and rules for the question and then performing queries based on the rules and conditions mentioned. Then using the query in the above code, we can find the name of city from the amount of rainfall and vice-versa, also we can find the region from the city-name and vice-versa.
