In this experiment, the goal was to implement the tic-tac-toe game using the informed serach strategy (A*). To find the optimal position to place the 'X' or 'O', first I calculated the difference between the winning combinations of user('X') and computer('O') for each choice in that round, then for the maximum values obtained, I then calculated which choice would not lead to computer's victory and would lead to user's victory by checking the number of moves required for victory for each choice and the one with least moves is selected. If there are similar moves then it selects at random where to place the piece.To be able to see the demonstration, download the main.py file and run the python file.
