In this experiment, the aim was to learn prolog programming and to perform few tasks using it.Prolog is used for logic programming, it helps to solve logic based questions easily as in prolog we first set the facts and rules given in the question and then according to the rules and conditions we perform tasks and queries.Here I performed list operations using prolog such as removing duplicates from list, slicing a list, creating subsets of list of given size and also to generate huffman code for the given symbols and their respective frequencies. Also I used prolog to genrate a family tree and wrote the required facts and rules and then executed the queries.
