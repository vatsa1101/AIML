In this experiment, the aim was to implement the K-Means clustering algorithm and to run the algorithm on a random dataset which in this case is a dataset containing the income and house price of people. Then using k-means algorithm, for k values 1-10, I calculated the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares(WCSS) values and plotted the Elbow Method graph which helps to find out the optimal number of clusters which comes out to be 3 using the graph.Then using this k value the graph with 3 clusters for income and house price is plotted and all the centroids along with their data points are plotted.You can check out all the respective documents uploaded above.
